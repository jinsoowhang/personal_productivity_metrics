## Background Information

A Jupyter Notebook visualizing and tracking productivity.

### Data source

The data is stored in a Google Sheets table.

I have been tracking my activities in a 15-min time block.

### Why?

Reading books and listening to productivity podcasts such as Deep Questions with Cal Newport have inspired me to create a data tool 
where I can track and analyze trends in my productivity.
