## Background Information

A Jupyter Notebook visualizing and tracking productivity.

### Why?

Reading books and listening to productivity podcasts such as Deep Questions with Cal Newport have inspired me to create a data tool 
where I can track and analyze trends in my productivity.

### Results

My productivity has been steadily increasing overtime. Here is a graph of productivity scores by week.
